# 3D Food Printing App 
 
Full-stack AI-powered mobile app that turns food ideas into 3D-printable designs. Simply chat with the AI about what you want to create (like "heart-shaped vegetarian pizza"), and the app generates a downloadable 3D model ready for food printing. Built with Flutter for the mobile interface and Python/Flask backend with Gemini AI for conversation and Meshy AI for 3D generation.

(Developed as part of UROP 1000 - Development of food 3D printing with the support of AI)
